In the rapidly evolving landscape of Over-the-Top (OTT) streaming platforms, the sheer abundance of TV show choices presents both a challenge and an opportunity. This abstract delves into the necessity of data analysis on OTT TV shows, highlighting the pivotal role it plays in unraveling viewer patterns and shaping the future of content delivery. OTT platforms host an extensive catalog of TV shows spanning genres, languages, and platforms. The diverse preferences of viewers, influenced by factors such as age, genre affinity, and platform accessibility, necessitate a nuanced understanding for platform providers, content creators, and advertisers alike. Data analysis emerges as a crucial tool to dissect and interpret the multifaceted landscape of viewer behavior. The rapid proliferation of Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms has significantly transformed the entertainment landscape, offering viewers a plethora of choices in TV show selections. In this project, we conducted an in-depth data analysis on an OTT TV shows dataset, leveraging the K-means clustering algorithm to unveil underlying patterns in viewer preferences. The dataset encompassed key features such as age suitability, IMDb ratings, Rotten Tomatoes scores, show titles, and the availability on popular streaming platforms including Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and Hot star.
